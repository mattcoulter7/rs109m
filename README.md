# RS-109M AIS Net Locator AIS buoy

This repo is contains a [config tool](rs109m.py) and some info about the [RS-109M](https://opcenter.de/pub/Boot/RS_109M_manual.pdf) Net Locator AIS buoy.

The device is sold by [Socotran](http://web.archive.org/web/20210806132018/https://socotran.com/products/fishing-net-tracker-locator-gps-marine-ais-netsonde-net-sonde-for-boating-rs-109m) and is also available on Ali\*xpress and e\*ay. In the UK, it is also sold by [East Anglian Radio](http://web.archive.org/web/20210806152420/https://www.eastanglianradio.com/rs-109-ais.html).

Information was gathered by personal observations like photographs of the PCB, and logging of the data stream while configuring.

## Attention

It is questionable if this device could be operated as a proper ("valid", "legal") AIS device!

Take appropriate measures when trying out things (e.g. shield RF, dummy load).

See [FCC statement](http://web.archive.org/web/20210806152632/https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DA-18-1211A1_Rcd.pdf) concerning the ban of fishing net buoys that use radio frequencies reserved for marine navigation safety.

## rs109m.py

[rs109m.py](rs109m.py) is a configuration tool written in Python 3.

## Internals

Unscrewing the cap gives access to on/off switch (a magnet which acts on a reed relais) and the charging and programming connectors:

## Manufacturer's PCSW 1.7 software

The software is available upon request from the dealer.
It is a Qt application compiled for Windows. I could get it to start with Wine 6.14 on Linux (Linux 5.12.15-arch1-1 x86_64, ArchLinux distribution), but had no chance to get the serial communications running.

![programming software screenshot](bin/images/pcsw17_screenshot_en.png)

Using the software on a Windows VM, I was able to produce some [logs](bin/logs/) to get knowledge of the serial protocol.

"Production mode" seems to do nothing more than incrementing MMSI number on subsequent writes.

## Configuration protocol

See [logs dir](bin/logs/) for data I obtained while doing tiny configuration changes.

The protocol is via serial 115200,8n1.

Device expects an init sequence with a password. This password is a weak protection, as it defaults to 000000 and is in the range of 0..999999.
It seems that the password protection can be bypassed by supplying a zero-length password init sequence.

Initialisation has to take place in the first few seconds after power-up.

After init, you can do 3 things:
 * read config
 * write config
 * set/clear password

Config is done as a whole block of data with some values weirdly stuffed together to save some space.

Original software always reads/writes 0x40 bytes, but there is possibility to access 0xff bytes.

When supplying an "update" command without actually delivering any data, there seems to be a glitch leading to contents from an unknown memory region being stored in config space.
This can be restored by simply copying default memory contents (0xff length) again.

It looks like the battery voltage is sent as 1/10V in place of the Reference A value.
Battery voltage is measured via a voltage divider (43k/56k or 47k/56k - can not measure exactly due to small part size) on PB1 (pin 19) of the STM32F103.

## Hardware

Buoy is built around Si4463 radio.

Microprocessor matches the layout of ubiquitous STM32F103C8, but as it has no markings, it could as well be a clone or different STM32 ARM µC.
A SWDIO debug port is available on the PCB (marked G=ground, C=clock, D=swdio, V=VCC), but did not check.

GPS module is ATGM332D with GPS and BDS/BeiDou support, but no GLONASS. It seems to be tied only with its TX pin to an RX pin of the µC.

[Adrain Studer did also some investigations](https://mobile.twitter.com/AdiStuder/status/1380290819056304130) and posted a [pcb photo](http://web.archive.org/web/20210809180746/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ex3FZafUcAIMJLL?format=jpg&name=4096x4096).
